# My portfolio
Hello! My name is Joren Van Hecke and I am a computer engineering student. Here I present some of the projects I've worked on.
## Cluster

### In short
A product to extend the knowledge of any existing company chatbot by adding crowdsourcing capabilities using NLP tools. Cluster consists of a server, an NLP module, a moderator module and API libraries for communication between NLP, chatbot and server. I mainly worked on those libraries, `cluster-connector` for the NLP in Python and `ClusterClient` for a chatbot written in .NET (Core). I also contributed to the server and the chatbot that was built as a proof of concept. This team project was the subject of my bachelor's thesis and was commissioned by the company Realdolmen.
